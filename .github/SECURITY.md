## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please send a report via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/haydenk/haydenk/security/advisories/new) or email me directly.

I will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
